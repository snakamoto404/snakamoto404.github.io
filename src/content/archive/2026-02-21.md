## [A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172)
**Domain:** Quant Finance / Market Microstructure / Stochastic Processes | **Time cost:** ~45min read

**Intuition:** This paper proposes one microstructural mechanism that jointly explains four empirical stylized facts: persistent signed order flow, rough volume, rough volatility, and power-law impact. The key move is decomposing activity into *core orders* plus *reaction flow* (both Hawkes processes), then taking a scaling limit.

**Concrete punch:** One persistence parameter $H_0$ governs all exponents in the limit:
- signed flow has Hurst index $H_0$,
- traded volume has Hurst index $H_0-\tfrac{1}{2}$,
- volatility has Hurst index $2H_0-\tfrac{3}{2}$,
- impact exponent is $2-2H_0$.
Empirically they estimate $H_0\approx 0.75$, which implies impact exponent $\approx 0.5$, i.e., square-root impact.

**Significance:** Instead of fitting volatility, impact, and order flow with separate ad hoc models, you can calibrate one core persistence statistic and propagate constraints through no-arbitrage structure. That is a practical reduction in model degrees of freedom for execution and risk systems.

**Why it matches:** Strong physics-lens fit: one latent exponent organizing multiple observables is exactly the kind of universality-style compression you prefer. It is mechanism-first (not benchmark-first) and directly useful for market microstructure modeling.

## [Flow Matching from Viewpoint of Proximal Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12683)
**Domain:** ML / Generative Modeling / Optimal Transport | **Time cost:** ~40min read

**Intuition:** The paper reframes Optimal-Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) as a proximal-point geometry problem. Instead of viewing the vector field as just a learned transport velocity, it shows the terminal recovery map is exactly a proximal operator of an extended Brenier potential.

**Concrete punch:** The proximal map appears explicitly:

$$
\operatorname{prox}_{\phi}(x)=\arg\min_y\;\phi(y)+\tfrac12\|y-x\|^2.
$$

They show OT-CFM admits an exact formulation of this type (without requiring target density), and prove *terminal normal hyperbolicity* for manifold-supported targets: after time rescaling, dynamics contract exponentially in directions normal to the data manifold while remaining neutral along tangential directions.

**Significance:** This gives a rigorous geometric reason why flow-matching trajectories can remain stable near low-dimensional data manifolds. It suggests concrete regularization and solver choices in practice (favoring geometry-preserving dynamics over purely empirical tuning).

**Why it matches:** Direct hit on your variational/duality taste (Brenier, convex analysis, proximal structure) and the discrete-to-continuous bridge in generative modeling.

## [Liquidation Dynamics in DeFi and the Role of Transaction Fees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12104)
**Domain:** Blockchain / Quant Finance / Mechanism Design | **Time cost:** ~35min read

**Intuition:** Liquidations in lending protocols are modeled as a dynamic program where the liquidator can manipulate a constant-product market maker (CPMM) oracle via sandwich-like trades (Oracle Extractable Value, OEV). The paper asks when fee design itself can neutralize that manipulation incentive.

**Concrete punch:** The liquidator’s control is an intertemporal optimization over trigger/manipulation actions under CPMM execution, with closed-form liquidation bounds. The main claim: there is a fee regime where expected manipulation profit is pushed non-positive (fees are not only a tax, but a security control variable).

**Significance:** This turns "fee tuning" into a formal security-hardening knob for protocol design, reducing reliance on slower oracle defenses (for example, only time-weighted averaging). It is immediately relevant to protocol parameterization and on-chain risk governance.

**Why it matches:** Excellent finance↔mechanism-design crossover with explicit dynamic programming structure and practical design implications under adversarial market microstructure.

## [HKML S3E11 — Hawkes Process and Market Microstructure: Too fast but not even furious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_o-uBimpMI)
**Domain:** Quant Finance / Point Processes | **Time cost:** 34min watch

**Intuition:** Compact seminar-style exposition of how self-exciting point processes explain clustered event arrivals in limit-order-book data and why continuous-price abstractions miss microstructural time effects.

**Concrete punch:** Uses the standard Hawkes intensity form

$$
\lambda_t = \mu + \int_0^t \alpha e^{-\beta(t-s)}\,dN_s,
$$

with branching ratio $\eta=\alpha/\beta<1$ as stability criterion. This directly links excitation strength to event clustering and endogenous liquidity shocks.

**Significance:** Useful as a fast refresher before implementing/calibrating Hawkes-based execution or impact models; aligns with today’s first paper on unified microstructure scaling.

**Why it matches:** High signal density, mathematically explicit, and directly operational for your market-microstructure stack.

## [Flash Boys 2.0 — Ari Juels (MIT DCI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yJa_6CtvHk)
**Domain:** Blockchain / Market Design / MEV | **Time cost:** 32min watch

**Intuition:** A crisp talk framing transaction ordering as a strategic game and explaining why decentralized exchanges can inherit high-frequency-style frontrunning pathologies.

**Concrete punch:** The key mechanism is ordering optionality: a searcher can insert/reorder transactions if expected extracted value exceeds ordering cost, i.e., exploit when

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{extracted value}] - \text{execution + ordering cost} > 0.
$$

This is the conceptual bridge to modern MEV/OEV liquidation games.

**Significance:** Strong conceptual companion to today’s DeFi liquidation paper: it clarifies *why* oracle manipulation and sandwich-style liquidation strategies arise in the first place.

**Why it matches:** Good systems+theory blend, mechanism-first framing, and direct relevance to blockchain microstructure research.
