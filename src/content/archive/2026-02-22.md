## [On sparsity, extremal structure, and monotonicity properties of Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16265)
**Domain:** ML / Optimal Transport / Geometry | **Time cost:** ~35min read

**Intuition:** Standard optimal transport (OT) is linear in the coupling, while Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) compares *relational geometry* and is quadratic in the coupling. This note asks a sharp structural question: when can GW optimizers be sparse (or even permutation-supported) instead of diffuse soft matchings?

**Concrete punch:** GW solves

$$
\min_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \sum_{i,k,j,l} \lvert d_X(x_i,x_k)-d_Y(y_j,y_l)\rvert^2\,\pi_{ij}\pi_{kl},
$$

so unlike linear OT, geometry enters via pairwise distance distortions. The paper highlights a **conditionally negative semidefinite (CNSD)** condition under which GW admits optimal plans that are sparse and can be supported on a permutation.

**Significance:** If your alignment problem satisfies that structure, you can search for low-support correspondences instead of dense couplings—better interpretability and often better numerical behavior for downstream matching/alignment systems.

**Why it matches:** This is exactly your preferred pattern: variational objective + geometric invariants + a crisp condition that changes algorithmic design (sparse/permutation support vs diffuse transport).

## [Neural Optimal Transport in Hilbert Spaces: Characterizing Spurious Solutions and Gaussian Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14086)
**Domain:** ML / Optimal Transport / Functional Data | **Time cost:** ~40min read

**Intuition:** Neural OT in infinite-dimensional spaces can produce fake optima when regularity assumptions break. This paper pinpoints when those spurious solutions appear and uses Gaussian smoothing to restore well-posedness.

**Concrete punch:** The approach perturbs inputs by a Gaussian process term (Brownian-style smoothing), i.e. conceptually $x \mapsto x+\xi$, $\xi\sim\mathcal N(0,C)$. Main result: with a regular source measure, the smoothed semi-dual problem is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map; success depends sharply on the kernel $\ker(C)$ of the covariance operator.

**Significance:** Gives a practical recipe for OT on trajectories/functions: if your solver is unstable or mode-collapsing in functional spaces, structured smoothing is not just a trick—it has a theorem-level justification.

**Why it matches:** Strong fit to your continuous-time and operator-level taste (infinite-dimensional geometry, regularity, covariance operators) with immediate implications for time-series transport modeling.

## [Autodeleveraging as Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15182)
**Domain:** Quant Finance / Market Microstructure / Online Learning | **Time cost:** ~30min read

**Intuition:** Autodeleveraging (ADL) in perpetuals is usually treated as exchange policy plumbing; this paper reframes it as sequential decision-making with regret guarantees. The venue chooses haircut actions each round to restore solvency with minimal over-liquidation of profitable traders.

**Concrete punch:** ADL is modeled as online learning over haircut decisions with regret benchmark

$$
R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \ell_t(a_t)-\min_{a\in\mathcal A}\sum_{t=1}^T \ell_t(a).
$$

On the 2025-10-10 Hyperliquid stress episode, reported regret is ~50% of an upper bound for production ADL vs ~2.6% for the optimized method; estimated over-liquidation gap improves from up to \$51.7M to about \$3M.

**Significance:** Turns ADL design from ad hoc queue rules into a measurable control problem with provable performance bounds—directly relevant for exchange risk engines and policy simulation.

**Why it matches:** Clean bridge from mechanism design to formal online optimization, with concrete dollar-scale consequences in real market events.

## [Kengo Kato — “Entropic optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein alignment”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-ylrbr1aBc)
**Domain:** ML / Optimal Transport / Statistics | **Time cost:** 52min watch

**Intuition:** Seminar-style walkthrough of entropic regularization and GW alignment with a strong statistics lens: what is tractable, what is identifiable, and where regularization changes the geometry.

**Concrete punch:** Entropic OT introduces

$$
\min_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)} \langle C,\pi\rangle + \varepsilon\,\mathrm{KL}(\pi\|\mu\otimes\nu),
$$

which converts hard combinatorial transport into smoother optimization and enables scalable Sinkhorn-type computation. This is the operational counterpart to today’s GW sparsity/permutation discussion.

**Significance:** Useful as the conceptual bridge from theorem statements to implementable solvers when you need both speed and geometry control.

**Why it matches:** High-signal, first-principles, mathematically explicit, and directly paper-adjacent.

## [Lighter vs Hyperliquid: Fees, Fairness, and ADLs — The Chopping Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCizHksGCC8)
**Domain:** Blockchain Market Design / Perpetuals Microstructure | **Time cost:** 1h06min watch

**Intuition:** A concrete post-mortem-style discussion of liquidation pipelines, insurance buffers, and ADL fairness under stress. Best used as systems context alongside the ADL paper above.

**Concrete punch:** Toy ADL allocation framing used in practice: for shortfall $S$ and profitable-account gains $g_i$, proportional haircut $h_i=\lambda g_i$ with $\lambda=\min(1, S/\sum_i g_i)$. This makes fairness/solvency trade-offs explicit and measurable.

**Significance:** Helps connect formal regret-minimizing ADL policies to operational policy knobs exchanges actually expose (priority rules, fee buffers, haircut schedules).

**Why it matches:** Mechanism-first analysis with real market plumbing and direct relevance to your finance↔systems lens.
