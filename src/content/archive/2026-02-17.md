3 paper picks + 2 video picks (same bundle for Telegram/email).

**Author-talk check:** No exact-title author/conference talks were found yet for today’s very recent papers, so I included two high-signal topic-adjacent YouTube lectures.

## [Efficient Sampling with Discrete Diffusion Models: Sharp and Adaptive Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15008)
**Domain:** ML / Generative Modeling Theory | **Time cost:** ~20min abstract+proof sketch, ~70min full read

**Intuition:** The paper studies discrete diffusion sampling through a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) lens and asks a practical question: how many sampler steps are fundamentally needed to hit a target KL error. The key payoff is that properly designed $\tau$-leaping can scale with intrinsic problem dimension, not raw token vocabulary size.

**Concrete punch:** For uniform discrete diffusion, the sampler achieves

$$
\tilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)
$$

iterations to reach $\varepsilon$-accurate KL divergence, removing linear dependence on vocabulary size $S$. For masking diffusion, convergence is controlled by an effective total correlation term with upper bound $\le d\log S$, and can be sublinear (or near-constant) on structured data.

**Significance:** This gives a principled sampler-budget rule for discrete generators (text, graphs, sequences): invest around intrinsic structure, not worst-case state-space size.

**Why it matches:** Strong mechanism-first theory, explicit KL-rate statements, and direct information-theoretic structure—exactly your preferred “concrete derivation over benchmark folklore” style.

## [FLAC: Maximum Entropy RL via Kinetic Energy Regularized Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12829)
**Domain:** RL / Generative Control | **Time cost:** ~15min abstract+algorithm skim, ~60min full method read

**Intuition:** Diffusion/flow-style policies are expressive for continuous control, but they break classic max-entropy RL pipelines because $\log \pi(a\mid s)$ is often intractable. FLAC reframes policy optimization as a generalized Schrödinger bridge toward a high-entropy reference process, so “stay stochastic while improving return” becomes a geometric control problem.

**Concrete punch:** The regularizer is path-energy based (kinetic-energy proxy), conceptually of the form

$$
\mathcal{E}(v)=\int_0^1 \mathbb{E}\!\left[\|v_t\|_2^2\right] dt,
$$

where $v_t$ is the policy flow field. The core claim is that controlling this energy bounds deviation from the high-entropy reference without explicit action-density estimation; FLAC then tunes the regularization weight via a dual (Lagrangian) mechanism.

**Significance:** Clean route to max-entropy behavior for expressive non-likelihood policies—useful when policy class power outgrows actor-critic assumptions.

**Why it matches:** Strong variational/bridge perspective, direct RL↔generative unification, and objective-level novelty (not just implementation tweaks).

## [A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172)
**Domain:** Quant Finance / Microstructure Theory | **Time cost:** ~20min abstract+model overview, ~75min full read

**Intuition:** This paper splits order flow into a persistent “core” component plus reaction flow (both Hawkes-based), then derives a scaling limit where multiple empirical stylized facts emerge from one persistence parameter $H_0$. Instead of fitting each phenomenon separately, it ties them to a single structural driver.

**Concrete punch:** With estimated $H_0 \approx 3/4$, the model predicts:

$$
H_{\text{volume}} = H_0 - \tfrac{1}{2},
\quad
H_{\text{volatility}} = 2H_0 - \tfrac{3}{2},
\quad
\gamma_{\text{impact}} = 2 - 2H_0.
$$

Plugging $H_0\approx 3/4$ gives $\gamma_{\text{impact}}\approx 1/2$, consistent with square-root impact.

**Significance:** A single-parameter bridge between persistent signed flow, rough volatility, and impact-law exponents is high leverage for model design and calibration discipline.

**Why it matches:** First-principles microstructure modeling with explicit exponents and no-arbitrage constraints—exactly your mechanism + invariants taste.

## [Generative Flows on Discrete State-Spaces | Andrew Campbell, Jason Yim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L9ekyTI21k)
**Domain:** ML / Discrete Generative Models (Video) | **Time cost:** 52m

**Intuition:** Research-style talk on transporting diffusion/flow ideas into discrete domains (tokens, graphs, combinatorial objects), which pairs directly with today’s discrete-diffusion paper.

**Concrete punch:** A central discrete-time/continuous-time modeling backbone is the master-equation view

$$
\partial_t p_t = Q_t^\top p_t,
$$

with $Q_t$ the transition-rate generator. This framing clarifies where sampling speed and approximation error enter in $\tau$-leaping-style methods.

**Significance:** Gives a practical mental model for when discrete generators need better transition parameterization versus better integrators.

**Why it matches:** High information density, mathematically grounded exposition, and direct relevance to your generative-model unification thread.

## [Ciamac Moallemi: High-Frequency Trading and Market Microstructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4z1FSdN_GA)
**Domain:** Quant Finance / Market Microstructure (Video) | **Time cost:** 25m

**Intuition:** Compact lecture linking inventory risk, adverse selection, and execution frictions to observed market-impact behavior—good complement to today’s unified order-flow theory paper.

**Concrete punch:** The lecture context is organized around empirical impact scaling of the rough form

$$
I(Q) \propto \sigma \sqrt{Q/V},
$$

where $Q$ is meta-order size and $V$ is market volume scale, alongside order-flow persistence intuition.

**Significance:** Useful for translating stylized-law intuition into concrete execution and risk-control decisions.

**Why it matches:** Mechanistic microstructure focus with model-level consequences, not infrastructure/tooling noise.
