## [Diffusion Alignment Beyond KL: Variance Minimisation as Effective Policy Optimiser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12229)
**Domain:** ML / Generative Modeling / RLHF | **Time cost:** 20 min abstract + 60 min method deep dive

**Intuition:** The paper reframes diffusion alignment as a **Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)** problem: the denoiser is a proposal process, and reward guidance induces importance weights over trajectories. Instead of optimizing a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence directly, it minimizes variance of log-importance weights, which targets stable, low-degeneracy particle dynamics.

**Concrete punch:** Define trajectory importance weight

$$
w(x_{0:T}) = \frac{p^{\star}(x_{0:T})}{q_{\theta}(x_{0:T})},
$$

and optimize

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VMPO}}(\theta) = \mathrm{Var}_{q_{\theta}}\!\left[\log w(x_{0:T})\right].
$$

The key claim is: this variance objective is minimized at the same reward-tilted target distribution, and under on-policy sampling its gradient matches KL-style alignment gradients.

**Significance:** This gives a cleaner control knob for diffusion alignment stability (effective sample size / weight collapse behavior) instead of only KL heuristics. It also unifies several existing alignment recipes under one Monte-Carlo-variance lens.

**Why it matches:** Strong mechanism-first content (not benchmark-only), explicit information-theoretic structure, and a principled bridge between alignment objectives and sampling efficiency.

## [Unlocking the Duality between Flow and Field Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02261)
**Domain:** ML / Generative Theory / Mathematical Structure | **Time cost:** 25 min abstract+theorem skim + 75 min for details

**Intuition:** Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) and Interaction Field Matching (IFM) look like different frameworks, but this paper asks whether they are actually two coordinate systems for the same dynamics. The result: a natural **forward-only IFM** subclass is mathematically equivalent to CFM, while general IFM is strictly richer.

**Concrete punch:** Central theorem-level claim:

$$
\text{CFM} \longleftrightarrow \text{forward-only IFM} \quad (\text{bijection}),
$$

while

$$
\text{general IFM} \supsetneq \text{CFM}.
$$

So equivalence holds on a precise subset, but IFM contains interaction fields that standard CFM cannot represent.

**Significance:** This is exactly the kind of unification result that compresses a fragmented landscape (diffusion/flow/field views) into a reusable map. It helps decide when a flow-matching parameterization is sufficient and when richer field parameterizations are needed.

**Why it matches:** Direct hit on the “unifying generative perspectives” preference; concrete structural claim with operational consequences for model design.

## [Accelerated Sequential Flow Matching: A Bayesian Filtering Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05319)
**Domain:** ML / Time-Series / Sequential Inference | **Time cost:** 20 min abstract + 60–90 min method + experiments

**Intuition:** Standard diffusion/flow pipelines often resample from a broad prior at each step, which is costly in streaming settings. This paper treats sequence generation as Bayesian filtering and warm-starts each generation step from the previous posterior, turning flow matching into a recursive belief-update engine.

**Concrete punch:** It aligns flow transport with the classical filtering recursion

$$
p(x_t\mid y_{1:t}) \propto p(y_t\mid x_t)\int p(x_t\mid x_{t-1})\,p(x_{t-1}\mid y_{1:t-1})\,dx_{t-1},
$$

then uses the previous posterior as initialization for the next transport. Reported consequence: competitive quality with full-step diffusion while using one/few sampling steps in streaming workloads.

**Significance:** For online market or sensor sequences, this is a practical path to lower-latency probabilistic forecasting without fully giving up multimodal generative structure.

**Why it matches:** Strong overlap with real-time sequence modeling + online learning interests; concrete algorithmic novelty rather than abstraction-only framing.

## [Stanford CS236 (Lecture 16): Score-Based Diffusion Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsllsC2JMGY)
**Domain:** ML / Generative Modeling Theory | **Time cost:** 1h 09m

**Intuition:** A compact, first-principles lecture that makes diffusion mechanics explicit: forward noising, score estimation, and reverse-time generation as stochastic dynamics.

**Concrete punch:** Core reverse-time dynamics are presented via score-driven drift correction:

$$
dx_t = \big(f(x_t,t) - g(t)^2\nabla_x \log p_t(x_t)\big)dt + g(t)\,d\bar{w}_t,
$$

with the score term $\nabla_x \log p_t(x_t)$ estimated by a neural net.

**Significance:** Best-in-class refresher for keeping the diffusion/flow bridge mathematically crisp while reading fresh 2026 variants.

**Why it matches:** High pedagogy + high signal density + directly useful for interpreting today’s papers.

## [Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Learned Solvers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaWxERImy0g)
**Domain:** ML / Scientific ML / Uncertainty | **Time cost:** 36 min

**Intuition:** Nils Thuerey frames diffusion models as uncertainty-aware solvers, not just image generators: learn distributions over solutions where deterministic simulators give only one trajectory.

**Concrete punch:** The denoising transition can be viewed as iteratively refining a noisy state toward a posterior-consistent sample,

$$
x_{k-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_k}}\left(x_k-\frac{1-\alpha_k}{\sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_k}}\,\epsilon_\theta(x_k,k)\right)+\sigma_k z,
$$

which is the computational backbone behind “probabilistic solver” behavior.

**Significance:** Useful bridge from pure generative modeling to physics/finance-style uncertainty propagation and scenario generation.

**Why it matches:** Mechanistic exposition with concrete equations and clear transfer to scientific/time-series modeling.
