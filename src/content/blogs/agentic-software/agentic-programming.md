title: Agentic Programming
date: 2026-02-12
summary: Placeholder post on agentic software workflows.
---

**Placeholder content:** This draft is a scaffold and will be replaced with concrete implementation notes and examples.

Agentic programming treats software work as delegated loops: plan, execute, verify, and iterate with guardrails.

```python
def loop(task, agent):
    plan = agent.plan(task)
    result = agent.execute(plan)
    return agent.verify(result)
```

Inline math placeholder: $\text{throughput} \approx \frac{n\cdot r}{t}$.

$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot e_i
$$
