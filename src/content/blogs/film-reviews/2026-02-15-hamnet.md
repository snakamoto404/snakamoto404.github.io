title: "Hamnet"
date: 2026-02-15
summary: "A review of Hamnet as a film where grief moves from memory to mechanism—bridging sparse history and the tragic interior pressure of Hamlet."
---

I watched *Hamnet* with almost no expectations — I didn't even know the film had anything to do with Shakespeare — and it became one of the most emotionally resonant films I've seen this year. **8 / 10.**

What makes it work isn't just the emotion, though. It's modern, individual-focused storytelling coupled with genuinely ingenious connections to *Hamlet*'s historical context and literary weight. In that sense, it reminds me of what Madeline Miller did with *Circe*: taking sparse classical source material and filling it with deeply felt, highly specific human development that makes the mythic dimension hit harder, not softer.

I think the film operates on two levels, and both are worth spelling out:

**The bridge:** The film invents an emotionally plausible connection between the thin historical facts — Shakespeare had a son named Hamnet who died young, and later wrote *Hamlet* — and a modern story built around concrete, deeply resonant family dynamics. The sparse history and *Hamlet*'s tragic gravity become amplifiers for each other.

**The transmutation:** The film's surface-level thesis is "the father commemorates the son through *Hamlet*." But a stronger reading — and the one I find more convincing — is that Shakespeare's polarizing grief and guilt gave him the emotional raw material for the tragic, introspective depth that actually defines *Hamlet* as a play. Prince Hamlet doesn't really resemble a boy-hero; his struggles are defined by hesitation, moral overprocessing, and reluctance that go far beyond anything in young Hamnet's story. The play's literary weight is elsewhere — and this film, at its best, shows where it might have come from.

There's also a meta-level at work: *Hamlet* is a tragedy, and tragedy induces catharsis — the release of emotion through watching noble individuals struggle and fall. The film achieves exactly this. It doesn't just tell you about the origins of a tragedy; it functions as one.

I'd recommend it most to anyone interested in tragedy as an internal process — where creation isn't closure, but a durable form for what can't be settled.

## A boundary note: fact, invention, interpretation

To keep things clear, I'm separating three layers:

- **Historical anchors:** Shakespeare had a son named Hamnet, the boy died young, and Shakespeare later wrote *Hamlet*.
- **Film invention:** a sacrificial illness story that turns biographical proximity into emotional causality — the film's creative contribution.
- **My reading:** the guilt mechanics, symbolic structure, and Thames scene that I think make the film resonate beyond its explicit framing.

None of this claims to explain how Shakespeare literally wrote *Hamlet*. It's about how the film creates meaning out of historical gaps.

## Going in blind: why the opening earned trust

I went in knowing almost nothing. I was mostly wondering why the title said "Hamnet" and not "Hamlet" — I didn't realize it was even about Shakespeare. That lack of context turned out to help a lot; I'd recommend stopping here if you plan to watch it.

The opening is rural, tactile, and a bit rough around the edges — the camerawork has a wobbly, almost personal-project quality rather than the polished look you'd expect from a period piece. It builds its world through nature, domestic friction, seedlings of love, discrimination against unorthodox women and men who don't fit the expected trades, and the weight of unfulfilled family expectations. On a simpler level, the nature-heavy texture is just a nice break from modern life — that alone is worth something.

That early register matters. The film later asks you to feel mythic emotional weight, and it earns the right to ask because it started at ordinary household scale. It doesn't begin with symbols and work down to people — it starts with people and lets symbols gather under stress.

## The hinge: illness, sacrifice, and emotional causality

The film's central invention — and the moment it stops being a period drama and becomes something more — is when illness arrives and Hamnet decides to sacrifice himself in Judith's place. That's what keeps "Hamnet / Hamlet" from being a name coincidence and turns it into a working emotional engine.

The chain goes like this:

1. Shakespeare encourages Hamnet to be brave — it's a fatherly value, passed down with affection.
2. When plague hits and Judith falls ill, Hamnet takes his father's teaching to its extreme: he bravely yields himself in her place.
3. Shakespeare isn't just bereaved — he was absent when it happened. Loss becomes self-accusation.
4. The later writing of *Hamlet* becomes less a tribute and more an attempt to process a contradiction that won't resolve.

That third step is the key. Mourning gives sadness. Mourning plus the debt of absence gives something closer to tragic recursion — and that's the engine the film runs on.

## Boomerang motifs: when early language comes back charged

The film seeds motifs early and brings them back with reversed charge. Hamnet saying he wants to be an actor with his father, to wield a sword over everyone else. Hamnet saying "I will be brave." These start as sweet moments of father-son affection and childhood imagination.

After his death, the same words return — but now they sound like evidence. What exactly did Shakespeare ask his son to be? And what did that request cost? The boomerang isn't decorative — it's the mechanism that turns encouragement into guilt, and guilt into the creative pressure behind the play.

## Commemoration vs transmutation: where I diverge

The film's explicit framing often leans toward commemoration: the father keeping his son alive through art. I accept that layer, but I think it's secondary — and slightly stretched.

Here's why: Prince Hamlet isn't really an admirable protagonist in a role-model sense. His struggles are defined by fate-driven introspection, hesitation, and reluctance — things far beyond a child's storyline. There's only a surface resemblance between a brave boy and a paralyzed prince.

The stronger reading, and the one the film earns at its best, is transmutation. Shakespeare's extreme emotional polarization — the trauma of loss compounded by the guilt of absence — gave him the ingredients to reach the emotional and introspective depth that defines *Hamlet* and makes it great. It's not that the son is memorialized in the play. It's that the grief rewired the father's capacity for tragic thought.

## Symbolic architecture

### Nature, cave, plague

Beyond the human drama, the film ties its emotional rhythms to nature. The forest offers a kind of multi-faceted calm — relaxation, retreat, the feel of something larger than domestic life. The cave works differently: it sits there unresolved even at the end, ominous, hinting at supernatural forces that human intention can't master. And the plague completes the picture as impersonal force — distributed, indifferent, unreadable while you're inside it.

Together, these block easy moral arithmetic. If the forces that killed Hamnet feel genuinely impersonal, then guilt has to be built inward, after the fact — which is exactly what happens.

### Water

Water shows up at every major transition: the flood around childbirth, rain when Judith first falls ill, the river when Shakespeare reaches his lowest point. Each return marks a threshold where control narrows and something irreversible begins.

There's also an Ophelia resonance worth noting — Shakespeare standing at a river contemplating self-destruction, and Ophelia drowning in a river as one of *Hamlet*'s most devastating images. The parallel is there whether or not the film intended it: grief, water, and the line between choosing death and letting it happen.

### Black door, underworld, theater

The image that stayed with me most is the pitch-black door appearing in the middle of bright, sunny woods. It makes death feel like a sudden gap in an otherwise normal day — not a total change of atmosphere, but a hole you could step through without warning.

This is primed by Shakespeare telling the story of Orpheus and Eurydice — the doors of the underworld, the idea that the dead aren't gone but separated by a threshold. (The film conveniently leaves out the end of that myth, where Orpheus gets torn apart by Maenads — probably wise for a bedtime story, though it might have changed the mood.)

And then the film does something clever with time. After Hamnet promises Judith he'll die in her place, there are later scenes where he appears to be taking a breath of fresh air, walking through the world again — but these are actually him in the underworld. The film slips between timelines without announcing it. And the full payoff comes at the end: the black-door imagery shows up seamlessly as the stage backdrop in Shakespeare's local theater, as if the boundary between death and art was always the same door.

## Jagged pacing, coherent shape

Most films march through plot developments at a smooth, predictable pace — character growth is regularized by, and handcuffed to, the forward motion of the story. *Hamnet* does something different. The pacing feels jagged and spontaneous: it cuts from ordinary domestic life into acute emotional pressure before you're ready, then recovers continuity later through returning motifs — weather, threshold spaces, repeated language.

The effect is less like prestige-film beat design and more like how grief actually works: surges, blanks, returns. The character dynamics and emotional textures take the front seat, and the plot serves them rather than the other way around. The result is something that feels both structurally continuous and genuinely surprising.

## Peak scene: the Thames brink

My high point in the film is Shakespeare standing by the Thames, contemplating throwing himself into the river. It's the moment where all the commemorative framing drops away and you see the raw engine underneath: a man split between the demand to keep living and the guilt that makes that feel unbearable.

This is also where I realized the character was Shakespeare — a powerful dawning that came when he considered "to be or not to be." If I connect that scene to the famous soliloquy, I mean it as an emotional through-line, not a historical claim about when the speech was composed. The scene works because it shows indecision not as abstract philosophy but as a real person standing at a real river, unable to move.

## Minor reservations

- At moments, you can feel the film engineering your emotions rather than letting them build naturally — the final shot with the audience comes close to tear extraction.
- A few of Agnes's lines are more explicit than they need to be; slightly more indirection would have increased their force.
- The direct "commemorate the son through the play" connection feels somewhat stretched, for the reasons I described above.

---

## Final verdict

*Hamnet* earns its **8 / 10** because it does the difficult thing well: it invents where history is silent, but with real structural and symbolic care. Even where I think its commemorative framing is secondary to the stronger transmutation reading, the film's best passages are precise, emotionally specific studies of how grief, guilt, and art reorganize one another.

I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see tragedy treated as an internal process — where creation isn't closure, but a durable form for what can't be settled.
